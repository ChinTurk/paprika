# DataGrid
Reacts component which helps in rendering vast amount of tabular data.

Main features:

- By design is a controlled component gives full flexibility to the consumer
- Virtualization provide by [react-windows](https://react-window.now.sh/)
- Sticky header, Sticky Column _right side for now_
- Easy mapping cell values and custom cell render via a render function
- Screenreader voice-over implementation **a11y**
- Support for keyboard navigation `↑`, `↓`, `→`, `←` **a11y**
- Easy Api for keyboard events `Enter`, `Space`, `Shift + Space` **a11y**
- Dynamic width and height for the cells [VariableSizeGrid](https://react-window.now.sh/#/examples/grid/variable-size)


## Installation
There are two main way to install `@paprika/datagrid`:

`yarn add @paprika/datagrid`

or

`npm install @paprika/datagrid`


## Context
Galvanize has a very tight relationship with Tables, DataGrids and Data. Our ecosystem is
full with them. These tables present and filter the data in different ways, sometime even
with different style and interaction patterns.

With this DataGrid we are standardizing the DataGrids in our ecosystem and at the same
time providing our developers with a component which is easy to use.

## How to use it?

### Simple

To do render a simple table you only need two things. One have an `JS` array with objects.

```js
const data = [{ myColum1: 1, myColum2: "hi"}, { myColum1: 2, myColum2: "hello"}, { myColum1: 3, myColum2: "hola"}];
```

Each object inside of the array will represent a row while the properties inside of each object will represent the columns

## FAQ

0. Should I use the DataGrid for all my Tables problems?

The DataGrid is a flexible component which might be sufficient for a lot of scenarios
where showing Tabular Data is required.

Saying that, there are some limitation with the DataGrid. The DataGrid is not meant to
be a Spreadsheet, neither to react dynamically to different size of content like a regular
HTML Table would do, so for this kind of scenarios is better to find alternatives solutions.

In doubt asked your fellow ux-developer or reach to us on our Galvaize's slack #paprika channel.

1. Performance issues within my DataGrid, how do I fix them?

While the DataGrid has been designed to render a lot of information, its performance can be affected by multiple reason like:

- Number of rows and cells rendered on the DataGrid in full screen.
- Number of screens connected to your computer.
- Scrolling by a mouse wheel instead a magic pad.
- The browsers some are better than others
- The UI and what you are rendering.

To mitigated some of these problems you could use `React.Memo` or `memonize` your components. Also you could
use [workerize](https://github.com/developit/workerize) to process complex logic, without blocking the main thread.

2. Sticky headers and columns on my DataGris are not sync while scrolling.

We are aware of this issue unfortunately, React-Window doesn't provide a build-in solution for sticky columns, we expect to mitigated this problems in incoming releases

3. How can I remove the `padding / margin` from the Cells?

The `<ColumnDefinition />` has a `cellProps` props that you can use to pass specific styles to your cell, as well any other attribute that you might require like classes or `data` attributes.

> Theoretically you could also pass down a _styled-component_ `css` prop using the `cellProps` but don't it, let's not exploit internal implementation details for styling our components.
