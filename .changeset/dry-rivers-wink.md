- 📦 `new` Introducing: inline-editing in alpha version ready to start integrating it but still needs work
- 💥 Breaking Change for Textarea removing an awkward way for declaring a ref in the textarea
- ⚠️ Remove keyboard navigation from the table for now, meanwhile we decided which is the best rout for this, we can bring it back later.
  this is not a breaking change because no body is using it!
- 🙋‍♀️ Table component now support
- 🔨 Upgraded collapsibleCard on the documentation
