Fixed issues related to keyboard operations:

- fixed inability to press 'space' button when in filter search bar
- fixed inability to select option(s) using only keyboard (i.e. space or enter operation) for single/ multi controlled ListBox
- fixed issue when selecting options in multi listbox, then typing space in filter bar that causes the selection/de-selection of the previously selected option
