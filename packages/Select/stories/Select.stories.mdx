## Notes

- Additional props and DOM attributes provided to `<Select>` will be spread onto
  the underlying `<select>` DOM element.

- The `<Select.Container>` component can be used as a `child` of `<Select>` to
  spread attributes to the root `<div>` container element.

- The `ref` will be forwarded to the underlying `<select>` DOM element.

- It is very important for **accessibility** that every `<select>` has a label.
  Usually this will be provided as a visible label with the Paprika
  `<FormElement.Label>`, but a label can also be provided directly for assistive
  technology clients (like screen readers) via the `a11yText` prop.
