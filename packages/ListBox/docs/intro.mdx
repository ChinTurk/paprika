# Listbox

From the [WAI-ARIA site](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#Listbox)

<blockquote>
  A listbox widget presents a list of options and allows a user to select one or more of them. A listbox that allows a
  single option to be chosen is a single-select listbox; one that allows multiple options to be selected is a
  multi-select listbox.
</blockquote>

This component handles both scenarios single and multiple selection.

  npm install @paprika/listbox
